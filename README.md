# Hi there, I'm Devran 👋

I’m a motivated mobile app developer who loves turning ideas into real apps.

Before I started coding, I was already curious about how technology works.  
I liked exploring things, learning by doing, and creating something from nothing.  
What started as curiosity is now my passion.

Right now I’m learning at Syntax Institut (2024–2025), focusing on **Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose)** and **iOS (SwiftUI)**.  
I enjoy building apps with a clean look and a smooth user experience.
